# Auto-install
A useful installer 

You can add names of other softwares that I didn't add to readme.txt in ‘installer’ folder.You also need to upload the Corresponding installation files to the same folder when you are updating the text file.

Notice：

1.Please update the readme.txt by the first letter of the word.

eg:

2.Please use formal naming instead of arbitrary naming.
(eg:dingtalk.exe✔;ding.exe✖,12d.exe✖)

3.Pleace only editing(when someone didn't edit the text file correctly) and adding something,but don't delete something.
