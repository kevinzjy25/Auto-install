# Auto-install
A useful installer 

You can add names of other softwares that I didn't add to readme.txt in ‘installer’ folder.You also need to upload the Corresponding installation files when you are updating the text file.

Notice：

1.Please update the readme.txt by the first letter of the word.

eg:

Please use formal naming instead of arbitrary naming.
