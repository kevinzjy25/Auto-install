# Auto-install
A useful installer 

You can add names of other softwares that I didn't add to readme.txt in ‘installer’ folder.You also need to upload the Corresponding installation files.

Precautions：

1.Please update the readme.txt by the first letter of the word.

eg:

Please use formal naming instead of arbitrary naming.
